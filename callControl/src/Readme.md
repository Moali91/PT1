# Call Control


## Introduction

A call control is a subsystem usually found in (virtual) circuit switched telecommunication networks (e.g. plane old telephony service). Its purpose is to control the establishment and tear-down of an end-to-end connection between the communicating parties. Signaling protocols are used to exchange the necessary data between the involved devices. The implementation of such protocols leads to the implementation of state machines.

In this task we look at simplified call control from the perspective of a terminal equipment (e.g. a mobile phone).

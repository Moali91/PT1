# Rational Calculator


## Introduction

The goal of this exercise is to implement a calculator that allows you to make exact calculations with rational numbers. A rational number consists of a numerator and a denominator separated by a slash, e.g. `2/3`. Allowed operations are additions (`+`), subtractions (`-`), multiplications (`*`), and divisions (`:`). The result of a calculation shall always be reduced, e.g. the result of `1/2 + 1/6` is `2/3`.
